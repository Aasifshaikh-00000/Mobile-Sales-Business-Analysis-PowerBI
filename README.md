# Mobile-Sales-Business-Analysis-PowerBI
End-to-end mobile sales analysis using Power BI, including data cleaning with Power Query, DAX-based KPIs, and an interactive business dashboard.

## Mobile Sales Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

#### Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end mobile sales analysis dashboard developed using Power BI. The goal of the project is to analyze mobile phone sales data and convert raw transactional data into clear, interactive, and business-ready insights.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor sales performance, understand customer purchasing behavior, and identify top-performing products and regions through dynamic visualizations and KPIs.

#### Business Objective
The mobile retail business deals with high-volume sales data across multiple brands, models, cities, and payment methods. The key challenge is to answer important business questions such as:
What is the overall sales and transaction performance?
Which mobile models and cities contribute the most to revenue?
How do sales vary across days and months?
What pricing and quantity trends influence total sales?
This dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making by providing a consolidated analytical view.

#### Key KPIs & Metrics
The dashboard tracks the following metrics:
Total Sales: 769.20M
Total Quantity Sold: 19K
Average Price: 40.11K
Total Transactions: 7M
These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot of business performance.

Dashboard Features & Visualizations
#### The Power BI dashboard includes:
KPI Cards for quick performance tracking
Sales Trend by Day to identify high and low sales periods
Top 5 Mobile Models by Sales for product performance comparison
Top 5 Cities by Sales to highlight regional demand

#### Interactive Slicers for:
Month
Mobile Model
Brand
Payment Method
Clear All Slicers option for easy reset and usability

##### The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter and explore data from multiple perspectives.
Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI for data modeling and visualization
Power Query for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing

Data Cleaning & Transformation

#### Using Power Query, the following steps were performed:
Removed duplicates and handled missing values
Standardized column names and data types
Cleaned categorical values (city, brand, model, payment method)
Prepared fact and dimension tables for efficient analysis
This ensured the dataset was analysis-ready and reliable.
DAX Measures Created

#### Custom DAX measures were developed to calculate:
Total Sales

Ranking logic for top models and cities
These measures allow dynamic filtering and accurate KPI updates across visuals.

#### Key Insights
